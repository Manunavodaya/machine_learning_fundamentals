### :point_right: About

This is a friendly handbook which is useful for familiarizing yourself with the basics of **Machine Learning**. I am preparing this handbook as part of ["The Bit Series"](http://elvissaravia.com/books/). Read more about our manifesto [here](http://elvissaravia.com/books/). Also, feel free to submit pull requests as there might be plenty of grammatical errors, spelling errors, and even inconsistencies in the content. I will try to update the book as frequently as possible. I am also keeping a log of my continuous updates [here](https://github.com/omarsar/os/blob/master/log.md). It is tough doing this alone, so I am definitely crediting anyone for their contributions.
